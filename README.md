Some things I wanted to keep on hand to work with a few CSV files between computers.

# CVSFormatter.py
I created this to re-format stocks to be placed in a dict.  So it reads column 0 and 1 in a csv and prints them to the console for copy & paste.  

Nothing fancy, but since I was dealing with 500 records I wanted to do it easier with python.
